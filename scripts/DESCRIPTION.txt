1.) EBird_Auk_filtering
-then mapped into ArcMap
-Each observation given a buffer of the user input observation distance for 
Area and Travelling checklists. For Stationary protocol, a 20 meter buffer was assigned
-Observations with their buffered distance were intersected with the closest waterbody
-Matrix output from ArcMap merged site covariates with COLO observation
  -waterbody area and perimeter from NHD dataset (citation), elevation at the site(citation), human influenced index (hii, citation), NLCD land type at each site (citation), and the eBird/WDFW observation information from original data
2.) SPfilteredEBird & FormattedData
-combine output from ArcMap, remove duplicates, format, and merge together
- Then use this matrix to format data into matrices and arrays to use in the model
4.) NimbleOccModel
-model code for running occupancy model using the formatted data
5.) ResultsPredandFigs & PosteriorsandTables & ConvergeDiag
-Convergence diagnostics and posterior distribution checks
-use model output to get estimates at each site, make figures, and to predict to sites not in the model
-Output matrix for site specific estimates to be mapped into ArcMap
